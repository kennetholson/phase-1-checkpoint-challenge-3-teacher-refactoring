# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
  It allows for either a value passed or a default

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
  It does not allow for much variety in the sub classes, modules

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
  It gives some margin of error when initializing

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?
  protects from data being changed that you don't want to be changed

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
  They allow for change down the line, the teachable module is only being used for students now but can be easily extended if need be.
